notes: |
  Widths are percentages represented by fractions. All classes are constructed like `.w-{nominator}/{denominator}`. By default you have halves, thirds, quarters, fifths and sixths. You can easily add more by changing the `$widths-columns` setting.

  Widths are independent from the grid and can be used by any component.

  Note that only the smallest fractions are generated; for example `.w-2/4` doesnâ€™t exist when both quarters and halves are in the settings, `.w-1/2` take over it.
